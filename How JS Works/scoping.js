// Lecture: Scoping only way to define new scope is a function not loops
// lexical scoping: a function that is lexically in another function
//                  gets access to the scope of the outer function




// Example to show the differece between execution stack and scope chain
// Execution Stack: order in which functions are called
// Scope Chain: order in which functions are written lexically
